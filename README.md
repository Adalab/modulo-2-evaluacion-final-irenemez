## About

**This project:** This project's goal is to create a page in which it is possible to visualize elements of a third-party API, as well as creating an interface that makes it possible to operate with them.

**Challenges:** the main challenge faced in this project was the joint implementation of every new added code parts without disrupting the existing code. For this, separate functions and events were created.

**Pending:** bonus section #1 and improving existing code from already completed sections from the assignment.

**Assignment outcome:** assignment's every basic section has been covered, along with the optional bonus of adding styling in SCSS.
